## ```LosslessStitcher.Spatial``` (Part of ```LosslessStitcher```)

---

### Purpose

This project contains spatial data structures - data structures that help organize and navigate 
information in a 2D space.

---

### Project organization

The project is divided into an abstract assembly and a standard implementation assembly.

In the future, there may be additional assemblies providing experimental implementations as well.
These experimental implementations will use the interfaces and basic types defined in the abstract
assembly.

#### Assembly: ```LosslessStitcher.Spatial.Abstract```

```LosslessStitcher.Spatial.Abstract``` contains interfaces, and a few basic data types (non-virtual)
needed by those interfaces.

#### Assembly: ```LosslessStitcher.Spatial```

```LosslessStitcher.Spatial``` provides the standard implementation for those interfaces.
